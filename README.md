# flight-app
A vue.js app connecting to a flights api.
- NOTE: I found that the old API doesn't work any more, so I'm rewriting the app now.

## Available Scripts
In the client directory, you can run:
### `npm install`

### `npm run dev`

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it in the browser.
